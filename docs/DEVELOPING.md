# Developing

## Directory layout

```
ngx-otel-rust/   ← this repo
<nginx-source>/  ← an NGINX source tree; NGINX_SOURCE_DIR points at it (default: ../nginx)
```

Building any nginx module needs an NGINX source tree. The Makefile and
`.cargo/config.toml` default `NGINX_SOURCE_DIR` to a sibling `../nginx`;
override it if your source lives elsewhere. The `ngx` SDK is a cargo git
dependency pinned in `Cargo.toml` and fetched automatically — no local
checkout required.

## First-time setup

```sh
# 1. Build nginx + debug module once (populates objs-debug/ and target/debug/).
make build

# 2. After that, rust-analyzer and bare `cargo check` / `cargo test` work
#    without going through make, because .cargo/config.toml supplies the
#    NGINX_SOURCE_DIR and NGINX_BUILD_DIR defaults automatically.
```

`.cargo/config.toml` contains `[env]` defaults pointing to the debug tree
(`NGINX_BUILD_DIR = "objs-debug"`). These defaults do NOT override variables
already set in the environment, so Makefile targets always win.

## Canonical test commands

```sh
make check             # rustfmt + clippy (zero warnings required)
make unittest          # cargo test --lib  (debug profile, objs-debug tree)
make unittest-release  # cargo test --release --lib  (release profile, objs-release tree)
make test              # bash integration suite (pins BUILD=release; see note below)
```

`make unittest-release` requires `make build-release` to have been run first
(to populate `objs-release/`).

`make test` always pins `BUILD=release` so the nginx binary, `NGINX_BUILD_DIR`,
and the cargo `--release` artifact are all from the same release pairing
(production-identical). For a debug-pairing integration run (e.g. to exercise
nginx debug assertions), use `BUILD=debug make test` — but note this writes a
release-profile `nginx-sys` artifact to `target/release` built against the
debug nginx tree, which poisons the cache for the next `make build-release`;
run `cargo clean` before `make build-release` afterward (the build-flavor guard
will flag the mismatch if you forget).

## Build-flavor guard

A build-time guard in `build.rs` enforces that the cargo profile and the nginx
tree flavor agree:

- **release profile + `--with-debug` nginx tree → hard error** (names the
  remedy). This is the hazard that `.cargo/config.toml`'s `objs-debug` default
  creates: bare `cargo test --release --lib` is blocked. Use
  `make unittest-release` instead.
- **debug profile + non-debug nginx tree → warning only** (unusual; tests still
  work, just without nginx's debug assertions).

Escape hatch (intentional cross-link): set `NGX_OTEL_ALLOW_FLAVOR_MISMATCH=1`.
Run `cargo clean` afterward to purge the stale release cache.

## Integration tests

Race and memory-safety detection run the integration scripts under
**ThreadSanitizer** and **AddressSanitizer** (Linux arm64, dockerized).
Results are committed as evidence (`tests/RESULTS-{tsan,asan}-*.txt`):

```sh
make tsan-test        # full TSAN suite (all integration scripts under TSAN)
make tsan-test-dns    # DNS / dual-stack resolver+connect path only
make tsan-test-error  # error-log path only (writer → ring → drain)
make asan-test        # ASan use-after-free gate (executor wake/teardown paths)
```

The path-scoped gates (`-dns`, `-error`) exist because some scripts are
timing-flaky inside the combined suite under TSAN's slowdown; running a
single path in isolation gives a clean race signal.

`make test` requires a running OTel collector on `127.0.0.1:4318`
(OTLP/HTTP) and `127.0.0.1:4317` (OTLP/gRPC). Start (and stop) the
project's collector with:

```sh
make collector-up      # start the local OTel collector container (idempotent)
make collector-status  # show its status
make collector-down    # stop it
```

The integration scripts assert against metrics that arrive at the collector,
so any OTLP receiver will work. In development the project uses an
`otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.152.0` Docker container with HTTP +
gRPC receivers and debug + file exporters.

Direct bash invocation (for debugging a specific test):

```sh
export NGINX_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/nginx \
       NGINX_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/nginx/objs
bash tests/integration/run.sh                        # metrics arrive end-to-end (OTLP/HTTP)
bash tests/integration/run_reload.sh                 # SIGHUP reload + counter-reset
bash tests/integration/run_grpc_export.sh            # production OTLP/gRPC export path
bash tests/integration/run_access_log.sh             # access exception tail + exemplars
bash tests/integration/run_error_log.sh              # coalesced error log + rate metric
bash tests/bench/zero_cost.sh                        # zero-cost-when-disabled (~10 min)
bash tests/bench/analyse.sh                          # re-derive tolerance check from JSON
```

There are 36 `run_*.sh` scripts in `tests/integration/` covering reload,
endpoint changes, gRPC variants, exporter lifecycle, crash-respawn, DNS/IPv6,
TLS, signal handling, and more. Run any script directly with
`bash tests/integration/run_<name>.sh`.

The bash integration scripts are due to be ported to Perl [`Test::Nginx`]
(see [Project layout](#project-layout) above); after that `make test` will drive
`prove -I $(NGINX_TESTS_DIR)/lib t/`. The load-driver scripts
(`tests/bench/*.sh`) stay bash — Test::Nginx isn't a good fit for
`wrk`-driven benchmarks.

## Comment style

Comments carry **rationale and invariants, not restatement**. They stay
sparse — a comment that re-describes the next line is noise. Rules:

1. Doc comments (`///`): one-line summary. Rationale goes in `# Safety` /
   `# Errors` / `# Panics`, not free prose. No architectural footnotes in
   API docs.
2. Module docs (`//!`): one paragraph. Design narrative belongs in
   [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md), not a 30-line module header.
3. Constants: one line. No multi-line "why this value" essays.
4. Inline `//`: only where intent is non-obvious. Never narrate self-evident
   code.
5. Decision-record rationale: 1–3 lines at the decision point.

**Always keep** (these are load-bearing, not bloat): `// SAFETY:` on every
`unsafe` block (`undocumented_unsafe_blocks = deny`); FFI / bindgen-bitfield
notes; memory-ordering / happens-before proofs; metric unit & semconv
contracts; spec citations; mutation-evidence in tests ("what this pins").

Do **not** chase a percentage. The FFI-heavy files legitimately sit at
25–45% comment density because that residual is mandatory SAFETY/FFI/ordering
content — cutting it would delete correctness anchors or break the lint. The
goal is zero *removable* narrative, not a target ratio. A one-time whole-crate
density pass ran 2026-07-01; following the rules above keeps it from being
needed again.

## Code conventions

Beyond formatting (`rustfmt`) and comments (above), the crate follows idiomatic,
review-ready Rust:

- **Errors:** a type that is logged or displayed derives `thiserror::Error` with
  `#[error("…")]` so each message has one source of truth (e.g. `TransportError`).
  A purely internal enum whose callers `match` every variant to take tailored
  action needs no `Display` — do not add an unused one (e.g. `TlsConfigError`,
  mapped variant-by-variant to `NGX_LOG_EMERG` lines).
- **Error propagation:** use `?` in functions that return `Result`. `extern "C"`
  callbacks and the no-alloc / no-panic request hot path have no `Result` to
  propagate — handle failures inline there; that is deliberate, not a gap.
- **Naming:** concise `snake_case` that reads as prose; production names stay
  short. Test names may be fully descriptive — they document what they pin.
- **Visibility:** `pub(crate)` for cross-module internal API; reserve `pub` for
  the crate's genuine public surface.
- **Decomposition:** small, single-purpose functions; split pure logic out from
  FFI glue so it is unit-testable without an nginx context (e.g.
  `validate_endpoint_tls`).
